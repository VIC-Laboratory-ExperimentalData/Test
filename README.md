# Test
This repository is for testing the BornOpen tools.

There is currently 
- BornOpenData4E-Prime.epk2 with its R function readBornOpenData.eprime2, a package for E-Prime.
- BornOpen4jsPsych.js, a plugin for jsPsych.

The repository Test receives the data files from either of these during beta testing.

The package BornOpenData4E-Prime was used in Maxcey, Shiffrin, Cousineau, & Atkinson (submitted in 2021, PB&R).
